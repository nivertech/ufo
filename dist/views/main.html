I grab their latitude and longitude which I then feed into the WeatherUnderground Geolookup API. That returns a city and state which I then can use with my NUFORC API to look for reported sightings in that location.</p><h3>Extras</h3><p>I used <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> to structure my application. Angular follows an MVC like pattern that breaks up different components of your application into modules. I wrote some custom services in Angular that follow the singleton pattern.</p><p>The custom services in <code>app/scripts/services</code>, filters in <code>app/scripts/filters</code>, and the controllers in <code>app/scripts/controllers</code> are the JavaScript I wrote. I got the filters and location service working with some help from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a></p><h3>Design</h3><p>It is designed for desktop use, but since I am using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> I could make some tweaks to make it more mobile friendly in the future.</p><p>I wanted to keep it very clean and simple so you can easily read the information that is presented. I thought about a dark theme because of the theme of the website, I thought it might fit, but I think dark text on light backgrounds is much more legible.</p><p>For the 'Past Sightings' page I was hoping to implement a calendar type view where you could enter a year then page through the months. It would show how many sightings were reported on each day in the calendar then you could click on a day to see more details. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time for this. Instead you can enter a specific date in history and view any sightings reported that day.</p></div>
